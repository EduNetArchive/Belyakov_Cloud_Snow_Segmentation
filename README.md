# Research work for cloud and snow semantic segmentation problem using meteorological satellite Electro L2 multispectral data #

**ABSTRACT:**

This project is devoted to the method of clouds and snow semantic segmentation according to the multispectral satellite images, received from a multizone scanning instrument used for hydrometeorological support and installed on the Russian satellite Electro-L No. 2. As the additional information, geographical information: latitude, longitude and altitude is used. The problem of snow and cloud discrimination is the absence of a spectral channel in the range 1400-1800 nm, which is necessary for their accurate separation, is considered. The results of this work include two new datasets from the meteorological satellites GOES-16, 17 and Electro-L No. 2 with the cloud and snow masks, as well as the trained Multi-Scale Attention Network (MANet) segmentation model, able to do accurate segmentation od snow and clouds for these satellitesâ€™ multispectral data. The proposed  neural network for clouds and snow segmentation has been tested for different seasons and daytime timestamps with different level of illumination of images. The developed algorithm is fully automatic, and it works in any season of the year during the daytime and is able to perform cloud and snow segmentation in real time mode for Electro-L No.2 data.

- Trained model for Electro L2 data can be loaded from model_for_Electro_L2 folder and used for data_inference in INFERENCE_PUBLIC.ipynb as an example

## Setup python version
The inference_public.ipynb file has been run with `python 3.9.7` on Windows 10 with NVIDIA CUDA supported 

### All required libraries are written in requirements.txt
- there are seperated requrements for each .ipynb in this repo! Be careful!
- just run in .ipynb this cell
```
 !pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### INFERENCE_PUBLIC.ipynb usage instructions:

- clone this repo on your PC and run INFERENCE_PUBLIC.ipynb
- Import all required packages and set up random seeds 42 everywhere.
- define your current directory and device: 
```
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
your_current_dir = os.getcwd()
```
- Than you can simply press 'run all' in your jupyter notebook and wait for parsing all inference data and working the MANet model predictiong through 192 pathes to eval cloud and snow masks for half off Electro L2 image
- Full precess of splitting channels to patches, making prediction and visualize it would take about 5 minutes, keep waiting
- During splitting, tqdm progress bar will help you to see the current progress stage 
- ATTENTION! Splitting all inference data will take about 2 GB of memory o your drive
- def merge_masks has 'save_mode' flag which is False by default, you can switch it to True to save the full prediction cloud and snow masks after merging it from patches
- during loading model there is a flag 'GOES_mode' which is False by default, you can switch it to True to use weights of MANet model, trained on GOES data
- In the last cell their is a visualization of ground truth masks from GOES-16 satellite, MANet model prediction and RGB image from Electro L2 with the metrics (FAR, IoU, F1) evaluation

#### GOES_data folder usage instructions:

- there is PARSIG&PROCESSING_PUBLIC.ipynb with lots of utils for GOES-16,17 data and it can be easily adapted for Electro L1, L2, L3, L4 or GOES-18 satellites as well
- this notebook can help you to open and process all neede GOES-R data to make your own dataset with snow and cloud masks
- this utils include reprojecting function from plate caree projection to geostationary projetion
